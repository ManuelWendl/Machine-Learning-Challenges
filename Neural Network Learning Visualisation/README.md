# Neural Networ Learning Visualisation 
This project has the aim to visualise the learning evolution of a neural networ in a very intuitive way.
### Task:
> Visualise the learning process of a neural network in a classification task. 
### Data:
> The data is a self genrated dataset, which can be seen in the first plot. It has got two classes, zeros and ones with respect to two features. 
> Of all original 4000 points, only 300 are taken for training. This is an extremly few umber of instances. This may hamper the performance of the classification 
> slightly, however enables a better visualisation.
### Classification Tool:
> For the classification, there was implemented a similar self built Neural Network, as already used in other repositories. Each learn epoch traverses all training
> data subjects. After each of these epochs, the model is tested on the whoole number of datapoints, inoreder to see the advance in classification. 
### Conclusion:
> Even though the training data is very small, it was possible to train the model up to an appropriate accuracy.
